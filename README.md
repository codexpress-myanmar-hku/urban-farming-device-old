# urban-farming-device
The Arduino Uno reads the moisture of the soil, the humidity and temperature of the air, and pumps water into it.

To-do list:
- [ ] We are adding the esp8266 esp-01 wifi module to connect it to [ThingSpeak](thingspeak.com).
- [ ] The deivce should upload the data via MQTT protocol.
- [ ] Will add soil temperature sensor.


Arduino software:

Added comment and explanation for codes and their functions.

Sending data to thingspeak through esp8266 available. Please set up the one for codexpress fast.

All sensors excluding DHT11 available. DHT11 not working correctly. Will debug in a few days.

Need hardware guys to improve the wiring.

Will improve for better performance in the coming week.
