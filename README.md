# urban-farming-device
The Arduino Uno reads the moisture of the soil, the humidity and temperature of the air, and pumps water into it.

To-do list:
- [ ] We are adding the esp8266 esp-01 wifi module to connect it to [ThingSpeak](thingspeak.com).
- [ ] The deivce should upload the data via MQTT protocol.
- [ ] Will add soil temperature sensor.
